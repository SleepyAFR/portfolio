		    <h3>Cybersecurity Incident Reporting System</h3>
		    <p>
		        Developed a secure, database-driven system for logging and managing cybersecurity incidents, 
		        enabling structured reporting, response team assignment, and audit-ready tracking. 
		        Admin users can view all incident data and reports, while non-admin users can report incidents 
		        by filling out a form with fields for incident description, severity (low, medium, high), 
		        and affected system (e.g., email server, payroll system). The system includes RBAC, 
		        real-time incident reporting, trend analysis, and secure audit logging.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		        Features include searchable and sortable incident and report tables, dynamic severity evaluation, 
		        and automated report generation by type (Daily, Monthly). Designed for responsiveness, integrity, 
		        and security, this system supports rapid response and organizational cybersecurity governance.
